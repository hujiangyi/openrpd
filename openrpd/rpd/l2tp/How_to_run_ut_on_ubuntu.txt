1. This document will guide you to setup the UT environment, Please following the steps. 

2. System requirement: 
	Ubuntu >= 14.04, 64bit.
	
3. Install the Python with l2tp:
	You can get the precompiled python with the following link:
	https://cisco.box.com/s/aj42xzmpafd0imfhmsk6wq9ozaogx90v
	
	After getting the python image, you can extract it and put it into some place, such as you home directory. 
	tar zxvf python.tar.gz 

4. Install the virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. virtualenv is used to setup a virtual python envioronment using a 
   specified python version or packages, instead of using the system python env. 

	sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

	If you don't install the pip in your system, you should install the pip first. 

	sudo apt-get install python-pip 

   Configure the virtualenv: 

	mkvirtualenv  -p /home/cmts/test/pythonBuild/bin/python testL2tp

	workon testl2tp 

	The first command will create a virtual env using the python that we have added the l2tp feature. The second 
	cmd will use the env. 

5. Add some dependent packages:
	
	in the env shell, execute the following commands:
	
	pip install python-daemon fysom pyzmq protobuf 

6. Last but the most important, probe the l2tp module into kernel: 

	sudo modprobe l2tp_ip 

7. Test the system setup:
	goto <l2tp>/l2tpv3/src/ directory, execute the following commands:

	python L2tpv3Main.py
